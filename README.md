# rave_wrapper
Super quick GUI wrapper for IRCAM's RAVE / nn~ external in Max/MSP. Allows dynamic loading of pretrained models to nn~, and passing audio files or mic input through the software.

## Setup: 
Download pretrained models by Antoine, which are referenced in the project, here. And then put them in your max search path.
